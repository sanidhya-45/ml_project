This repository contains comparison of KNN and CNN on basis of the accuracy achieved when both are used for classification on the datasets CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
Turns out CNN performs better than KNN on both the datasets, the accuracies have been included in the files.
Both the datasets can be imported from Keras library in python.
